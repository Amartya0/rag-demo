    How do fully segregated busways differ from priority bus lanes in traffic management?
    The integration of public transport priorities in traffic management is vital, especially considering the challenges posed by the slower speeds and frequent stops of buses. Strategies like dedicated lanes and segregated busways help counteract the negative impacts of mixed traffic, encouraging increased bus usage. While priority bus lanes provide a basic solution, they come with limitations, such as hindering roadside access and susceptibility to intrusion. On the other hand, fully segregated busways, featuring central lanes and controlled pedestrian crossings at stations, offer a comprehensive approach. This model has demonstrated success in cities like Bogot√° and Curitiba, showcasing efficiency improvements, emission reductions, and better air quality. By effectively managing and sustaining public transport operations, cities can achieve a balance between congestion reduction, air quality enhancement, and commuter convenience.
    Fully segregated busways offer a comprehensive solution with central lanes and controlled crossings, unlike priority lanes that have limitations and can impede roadside access.
